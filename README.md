# ip_address_tracker

### Hey there!
In this app 2 we are to request an ip and the app will use 2 APIs: 

1.- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org) to get coordinates from the entered IP.

2.- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is use to render a map and where we locate the coordinates obtained from the Geolocation API

With this we can show a location of any IP entered by the user
